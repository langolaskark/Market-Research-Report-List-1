<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beam Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>Projected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Beam smoke detectors are available in two primary types: reflective and projected. Reflective beam detectors consist of a light source and a sensor positioned at various angles, detecting smoke by measuring the reduction in light intensity when smoke particles obstruct the beam. Projected beam detectors, on the other hand, send a beam of light between a transmitter and receiver over longer distances, triggering an alarm when smoke interrupts the light path. Both types are effective in large open spaces, maximizing detection efficiency.</p></p>
