<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone densitometer market primarily includes two types: DEXA and ultrasound devices. DEXA, or Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, is the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density, providing precise assessments vital for osteoporosis diagnosis and management. It utilizes low-level X-rays for detailed imaging. On the other hand, ultrasound bone densitometers employ sound waves to assess bone quality and density, offering a radiation-free alternative. Both types cater to different clinical needs and patient preferences, influencing their market demand.</p></p>
